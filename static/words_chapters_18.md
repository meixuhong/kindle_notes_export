> 本打算农历年前完成这本书的，虽然在腊月二十九就听完了，但是回去之后一直没能抽出时间总结总结，上班后起了个早，重新总结总结，算是圆满完成本书的听读了。
>
> 总得说来，JK确实不按常理出牌，以后听剩下的书的时候也可以猜测那些悬念，但凡是过于明显的，一定不是真想。。。比如Percy的异常，大话王Gilderoy本应该可以写更多的故事（也许真是我想多了）, 还有本以为Harry与Tom是远房亲戚，结果却被Dumbledore告知其实是因为Voldemort不经意将其能力注入了Harry。
>
> 另，JK写本章节的时候，应该是**笔友**盛行的时代，估计她想借此隐喻笔友多么地不靠谱，o(╯□╰)o
