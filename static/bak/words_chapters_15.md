> 这一章节没什么难度，倒是很好奇作者布下的这许多悬念，肯定与第一本书一样有许多意外之处，目前猜测Lockhart属于新加入的老师，虽然牛逼哄哄，看起来没啥真本领，但是疑点很大，也描述经过多次dark-arts斗争/相遇过，而且前面特意描述他去拜访过Hargid的小插曲，不排除他与Voldemort勾搭在一起的可能性。**注:庆幸没有观看这几部电影，要不然这些精彩的悬念早就毁了**.

# 2. would have done用法
从前面的多次总结中已经知道这个提了N*N遍了，继续安利不厌其烦。 would have done, could have done除了表示 **本应该…**，还表示 **可能** 的意思。下面的这个句型非常值得引用学习

> ‘My dear young man, the Minister of Magic **wouldn’t have taken** Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred per cent sure that he was guilty,’

# 3.固定词组 resign to用法

resign 本意为辞职的意思，resign to组成固定词组表示*平静的接受某件事/事实* ：calmly accept something unpleasant or can't change.

> -‘OK,’ Ron sighed, as though **resigned to** the worst, ‘I’m ready. Let’s go.’
