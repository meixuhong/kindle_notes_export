**## 6.1 介词 along 作“沿着”讲**

>1. Many trees were planted along the river-bank. 沿着河岸种植了许多树。
>2. There are trees all along the road. 沿着这条路从头到尾都有树。
>3. We must think along certain regulations. 我们必须依照某些规定来思考。

注：汉语中的“沿着这个方向”或“沿着这条途径”不能用 along…，而要分别表示为 in this direction 或 in this way。这里 in 作“按照”讲。

**## 6.2 副词 along 作“向前”讲，常与有关动词或介词 with 连用，构成一些常用词组**

> 1. We’ll be along about eight. 我们八点左右过来（或过去）。
> 2. I want to bring my daughter along to see you. 我想把女儿带来看望你。
> 3. The children were brought along well inschool. 孩子们在学校受到良好教育。（由孩子们在校内被好好地带领或引导向前“引申过来。如果是 The fine weather will bring the crops along very nicely. 则应理解为好的天气大大促进农作物的生长”。但这里 bring … along nicely“把…往前带”的原意仍为“好好地把……带领向前”。为此必须深刻理解“把……往前带的”原意，才能真正体会到英汉词典上的注释“教育或帮助（某人）发展”、“促进（农作物）生长”等含义的由来。
> 4. The bus conductor often says "Pass along the car please" or "Move along please". 公共汽车售票员常说“请往车里走”或“请往前走”。（句中第一个 along 为介词，而第二个为副词。仍应按原文本意去理解译文。）
> 5. How are you getting along? 你（生活过得）好吗？
> 6. How is she getting (或 going) along with her work? 她工作进展如何?（相当于：How is her work getting (或 going) along?）
> 7. He gets along very well with us. 他和我们相处很好。
> 8. She will send it back along with some other things. 她将此物与其它东西一并送回。（句中 along with… 系单独使用，作“与…一起”，可用 together with…来互换。）
> 9. The mechanization of agriculture will raise the output, and, along with it, the living standard of the peasants. 农业机械化将提高产量，同时也将提高农民的生活水平。（句中 along with 本意不变，但译为“同时也”。应该说，这是根据原文本意并结合汉语表达方法作出的正确翻译。）
> 10. I knew that all along. （那时）对那件事我一直（或始终）真知道。

注：“动词 + 副词 along”的其它常用短语还有：carry… along 携带（一个大包裹即 a big parcel），（洪水即 the flood）挟带（树木即 trees），help sb. along（或 on, toward）帮助某人前进或进步，move along 往前走，（或走开，别停留），take …along 带走（某人或某物）等。
